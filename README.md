# Kick-off-2022

## Intro

The football clubs look to gain a competitive edge on and off the pitch, and big data is allowing them to extract insights to improve player performance, prevent injuries and increase their commercial efficiency. The utilization of data in football (or soccer) has become very important to develop player skills or match analysis. The main objective of this hackathon is to evaluate the playerâ€™s commercial value, based on their skill-set and performance history.

We calculate the worth of a player based on the given dataset with various parameters and characteristics of the players using a baseline LGBM Model.
